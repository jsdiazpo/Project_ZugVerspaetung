# Project_ZugVerspaetung
Goal: a simple app that sends an alert to my phone when my daily train is delayed

Roadmap:
 1. create Python script that pulls train schedules from Deutsche Bahn web
    - simple web scrapping: BeautifulSoup
    - simple programming tasks: get journey details (origin, destination, time), check train schedules, find if delayed, notify
 2. create bot that can send a message to phone
    - use Telegram bot

 3. integrate Python scripts with bot scripts
    - maybe allow for some interaction with user?

 4. create web app
    - simple Flask web app
   
 5. deploy on the cloud for continuous run
    - Heroku
